a) 	On branch development
	Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/development'.
	nothing to commit, working tree clean

b) 	7 commits have been done on this repository. I used "git log" in order to 
	find this information
	
c)	The file .gitignore was last modified Oct. 19 04:35:58. i used: git --follow .gitignore 

d)	e7831f6, a46d926, icc7d66

e)	One reason to use branches in Git repositories is so that a team can work together in 
	building a software at the same time rather than on just one computer or one at a time.
	Another reason is that you can isolate any changes you add to the software, which could
	include adding features or fixing bugs.
	
f) 	git log shows the complete history of all commits that were made, while git status shows
	the current working tree status of what is currently being committed
	
g)	git log --follow Weapon.h

h) 	git log --grep "file"

i)	I) Inhertiance enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects.
	II) Polymorphism is the ability to process objects differently depending on their 
		data type. For example, finding the area of a base class shape. Polymorphism
		allows you to get the area regardless of the shape, whether its a triangle,
		circle, ect.
	III) Encapsulation is when you protect both the data and functions that manipulate 
		the data from outside interference. It hides the functions and implementations
		from the user. For example, defining data in a function class to be private 
		is protecting it from other users since only the class can call it.
